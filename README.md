The graphical illustration was divided in three separate projects.

**Project-1**

In this phase, we start from the basics. The canvas is divided into triangles (convex shape for simplicity and versatility). The triangles consist of three vertices,
each having its own coordinates on the canvas. Every triangle vertex also has an RGB value, which corresponds to its color. The filling of all triangles, existing on 
the canvas, is main goal of the first phase.
