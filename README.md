# triangle-filling

All necessary information about the project is included in the paper, under the **report** directory. Everything you need to know about triangle filling and image rendering is extensively discussed with algorithms and graphical illustrations.

To run the code, execute
```
demo_flat.py
```
for flat rendering, and
```
demo_gouraud.py
```
for smooth rendering. Both files are located inside the **src** directory. The result is going to be saved under the **results** directory, overwriting the previously stored images.
